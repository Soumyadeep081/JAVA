-> Topological Sorting is a linear ordering of vertices of a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge

u→v, vertex u appears before vertex v in the ordering.

#Key points:-
1. Applies only to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

2. Respects dependency relationships

3. There can be more than one valid topological order

4. If a graph contains a cycle, topological sorting is not possible


#Formal definition:-

A topological sort of a directed graph G=(V,E) is a permutation of the vertices V
such that for every edge (u,v)∈E, u precedes v in the ordering.


#Common methods to perform it:-

1. BFS-based: Kahn’s Algorithm (using indegree)

2. DFS-based: Using recursion and stack

#Typical applications:-

1.Task scheduling

2.Course schedule problems

3.Cycle detection in directed graph

4.DeadLock detection
