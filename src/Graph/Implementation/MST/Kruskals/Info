Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithm

A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted,
connected, and undirected graph is a spanning tree (no cycles and connects all vertices)
that has minimum weight. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all edges in the tree.

Below are the steps for finding MST using Kruskal's algorithm:

1. Sort all the edges in a non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far.
If the cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.  It uses the Disjoint Sets to detect cycles.
3. Repeat step 2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.

It picks the minimum weighted edge at first and the maximum weighted edge at last. Thus we
can say that it makes a locally optimal choice in each step in order to find the optimal solution.
Hence this is a Greedy Algorithm.
