//DFS to find the first Island.
If cell == 1 add it to the queue and mark it as visited and move to its adjacent cells.
If adjacent cells are also 1 then add them too to the queue and mark them visited as well.
Repeat this until no more adjacent 1's are left and only adjacent 0's are present.
This connected component of adjacent 1's is the first island.


//BFS to Expand the Island and find the distance from first island to second island.
Run a loop until queue is empty (i.e. shortest distance form 1 island to next is found).
Pop from front and check its newR and newC in all directions.
If newR and newC is already visited then skip else check if its 1 then return current steps.
else mark newR newC as visited, add them to queue, and repeat this for all dirs.
steps++ at the end.
