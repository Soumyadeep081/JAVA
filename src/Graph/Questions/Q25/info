Shortest Path in Undirected Graph

You are given an undirected graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 and E edges,
represented as a 2D array edges[][], where each element edges[i] = [u, v] represents an
undirected edge between vertices u and v.

Your task is to find the shortest path distance from a given source vertex src to all other
vertices in the graph.
If a vertex is not reachable from the source, return -1 for that vertex.

Note: All edges have unit weight (1).
