Approach:-

1. Reverse the graph
For every directed edge u → v in the original graph, add an edge v → u in the reversed graph.
This helps us move backward from terminal nodes to nodes that depend on them.

2. Track indegree (actually outdegree of original graph)
For each node, maintain how many outgoing edges it has in the original graph.
In the reversed graph, this value behaves like an indegree.

3. Initialize BFS queue
Push all nodes with inDeg = 0 into the queue.
These are terminal nodes in the original graph and hence safe.

4. BFS (Topological processing)
Pop a node from the queue and mark it safe.
For each of its neighbors in the reversed graph, decrement their inDeg.
If any neighbor’s inDeg becomes 0, add it to the queue.

5. Collect result
All nodes processed by BFS are safe.
Finally, sort them in ascending order as required.
