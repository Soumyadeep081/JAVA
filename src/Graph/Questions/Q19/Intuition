A node is considered safe if every path starting from it eventually ends at a
terminal node (a node with no outgoing edges).
So, instead of directly trying to detect cycles, we can think in reverse:

Terminal nodes are always safe.
Any node that only leads to safe nodes is also safe.
Nodes that are part of cycles, or can reach a cycle, are unsafe.

This naturally suggests a topological-style approach, where we start from terminal nodes and move backward.
