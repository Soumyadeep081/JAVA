A bipartite graph is a graph in which the set of vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that:

Every edge connects a vertex from one set to a vertex in the other set

No edge connects two vertices within the same set

Formally, a graph G=(V,E) is bipartite if
V=U ∪ W, where: U ∩ W=∅
For every edge (u,v)∈E, either
u∈U and v∈W, or u∈W and v∈U

#Key properties:-
->A bipartite graph is 2-colorable (you can color vertices using two
colors so that adjacent vertices have different colors).
->A graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd-length cycle.
->Trees and even-length cycles are always bipartite.

#Applications:
1.Scheduling time table
2.Conflict resolution
3.Bipartite
4.Map coloring
